A basic React app to search through the OpenTable API by city

1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had
more time? If you didn&#39;t spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to
explain what you would add.

  *   Worked on and off for a few hours.  I'd add in pagination if I had more time. I'm not naturally a designer, so trying to make it look nice may have been my greatest challenge.  Open source fonts and some color guides helped...

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language?

  *   Arrow functions in ES6 make things nice and neat. Also, the filter function.

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

  *   I've done the basics.  Checking the network tab is a good resource - what's taking so long to load?  Running a site-speed analysis from Google also provides useful insights.

4. How would you improve the API that you just used?

  *   I really didn't have time to look at it thoroughly.  I'd like the cost to be shown in "$$" instead of an integer.  I had to use a switch statement to show dollar values.  Also, a link to the restaurant's actual site would be nice.

5. Please describe yourself using JSON.

  *   I call an API request with Fetch, Axios, or some other means, then I parse and style that data as necessary.  I've also created my own APIs, and created front-end React clients to interact with the data.
